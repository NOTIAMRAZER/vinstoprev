                <hr>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">This game is one of the most popular games in the world. The game is into it's fourth year in the gaming industry. In the the last 4 years of fortnite, It is estimated that Fortnite's net worth is aproximately $2,000,000,000. People can play this game in three different game modes namely "Battle Royale", "Save The World" and "Creative". Battle Royale is a fun game mode where people can choose between different modes such as LTMs, solo, duo, etc. This is one of the most played game modes in Fortnite. Save the world is the first ever game mode released as paart of Fortnite, in this game mode players have to save their own base by defeating different waves of monsters; one can also play a mode in which you have to defeat the mighty storm king which in my opinion is a little hard. Just like the name suggests, Creative is the game mode in which players can think outside the box and make their own fun maps!
                Makers recomend minimum age of 12 years; the game can be enjoyed by teens and adults equaly.Well it's safe to say that "Epic games" absolutely smashed this one!</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">There is a great chance you would know this game if you are an Indian, Well thats because after the ban of India's most popular game "PUBG", the Indian PUBG gaming comunity needed a new shooting battle royale game and well the only game which was worthy alternate was "Free-Fire". This is a decent game , but the makers would like to work on the graphics on their next update. But all things said, it's still is a nice job done by Garena.</p>

This game is one of the smoothest in terms of the UI, Graphics in the world; I also beleave that this is the most glich-less game in the world.

                <p>This is one of the best movies put together by Marvel yet. I'm sure you wont understand 30% of the movie if you haven't seen the previous avengers movie-"Infinity War", But those who have they will understand the whole movie. Anyway this amazing piece of Hard work by Marvel is realy apriciated and is one of the best superhero movie that the world has ever seen and I can guarantee this for sure that this 3hr long movie is totaly Worth it!</p>

                <p>One of the finest and greates horor films out there and if you are 18 and not scared then i'll sugest you to just take your Popcorn, Cold drink and just sit down and watch this scary amzingnes. But, this movie is not just scary it also has madness, yes madness, you'll see alot of fight scenes, mental laughing and many more, The scary bit keeps on coming little by little and in the last the final battle happens. But i'm sure You won't be able to understand almost the whole movie unless you have seen the previous movie-"It". Overall, amazing job by the makers!</p>
